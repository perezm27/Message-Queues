## Lab: SQS - Message Queues
For this lab, you will be creating a few Message Queues and Broadcasters and wiring them through code.

## Feature Tasks
* Create 3 Standard Queues  
QueueA  
QueueB  
QueueC  
* Create command line applications in Java that use these queues
* Queue Publisher  
Sends a message to a queue, using its ARN or URL  
* Queue Client
Receives messages from a Queue (by ARN) and displays them  
* Food for thought â€¦  
Which library will you choose to connect to the SQS system?  
How can you librarize your own solution so as not to be esoteric to a single application?
